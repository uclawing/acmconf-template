LTE revises and improves system architecture from UMTS to provide services that are more efficient. Evolved-UTRAN (E-UTRAN) is the air interface of 3GPP and it is on the upgrade path for LTE mobile networks. E-UTRAN specifies better security architecture to protect users' information. However, E-UTRAN is still not perfect. This article studies vulnerabilities of non-access-stratum (NAS) of E-UTRAN. We present illustrative attacks to exploit such vulnerabilities and demonstrate the effectiveness and the impact of such attacks on normal users by using our self-developed simulation tool.},

Obviously, it is theoretical work. They assume that all nodes are homogeneous and consistent against virus. However in fact, we can see that for an internet virus/worm, firstly most nodes are vulnerable, and virus spread rapidly; but later, nodes are getting stronger, even stronger than virus itself. You know, the fact is fewer attacker, more guards; but attack is more dangerous and powerful},

(in area of software engineering (source code)); conclusion:1) In a perfect world, and for systems largeand complex enough for statistical methods to apply, the attack and the defence are helped equally. Whether systems are open or closed makes no difference in the long run. 2) But in reality, it may depends on the circumstance in which this symmetry can be broken. },
