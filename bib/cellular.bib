	Abstract = {Horizontal and vertical handoffs are important ramifications
of user mobility in multi-tier heterogeneous cellular networks.
They directly affect the signaling overhead and quality
of calls in the system. However, they are difficult to
analyze due to the irregularly shaped network topologies introduced
by multiple tiers of cells. In this work, a stochastic
geometric analysis framework on user mobility is proposed,
to capture the spatial randomness and various scales of cell
sizes in different tiers. We derive theoretical expressions for
the rates of all handoff types experienced by an active user
with arbitrary movement trajectory. Empirical study using
real user mobility trace data and extensive simulation are
conducted, demonstrating the correctness and usefulness of
our analysis},
